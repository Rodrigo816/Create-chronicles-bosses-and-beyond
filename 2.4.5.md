# Changelog

## Version 2.4.5

### Changes:
- Fixed crash when using trains.
- Increased the amount of shimmer obtained from corundum clusters.
- New spider mobs and some minor content from the Born in Chaos mod.
- In Chapter IX, crafting lumen paint balls no longer uses dyes; it now requires rock candy from Alex's Caves, so you are now required to find candy caves to progress.
- Adjusted chromatic waste ratios.
- Added alternative recipe for steel ingot for those having problems on the server. It's not the optimal way, but let's hope TFMG fixes their stuff.
- Fixed 2% Ars Nouveau Mana Regen node giving 1% instead of 2%.
- Added data models for all candy cave mobs.
- Updated mods.
