				"The &aRibbits&r have an enjoyment for music, they can be found playing various instruments by themselves or in groups, like a Frog band, makes me wonder if they are playing the Frog Choir? At least the moon is not falling in 3 days haha."

				"&b->Witches: &rThey may occasionally give you random potion effects."
				""
				"&b->Fisher:&r They can be found fishing near the lake swamps and you can trade with them and curiously they give out &ccolorful corundum&r. How do they get it? Researchers are still looking into that."
				""
				"&b->Farmers:&r They make crops grow faster. They have a formula that the water they pour is just like bone meal! Fascinating! "
				""
				"&b->Merchants:&r They are merchants, you can spot them by their backpack and they trade with you. Surprisingly they &ctrade corundum in various colors&r and a&d Maraca&r. We don’t know where they get the corundum from but the colors of corundum they have for trade changes from Merchant to Merchant. &l&o&nThis is nice since you know you'll need all the colors of corundum later!"
