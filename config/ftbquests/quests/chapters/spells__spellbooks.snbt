The scroll can be consumed to cast that spell without consuming mana or triggering a cooldown, or brought to the first new workstation added: the Inscription Table. At the inscription table, you are allowed to place a spell book, one either found or crafted, and slot the scroll into it. However, depending on the rarity of the scroll (determined by the spellâ€™s level), it may be too powerful for your spell book. In this case, you must go forth on a journey to obtain a better spell book."
