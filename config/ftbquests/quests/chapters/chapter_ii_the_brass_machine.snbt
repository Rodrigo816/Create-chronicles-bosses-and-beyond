				"&c&nNote: It also works with Item Vaults&r&r"
				""
				"&2Step 2:&r You can place a chest on either side of the&6 Inventory Connector&r and it will read its contents. You can even stack the chests on top of each other and the Inventory Connector will still read their contents as long as one chest is touching the Inventory Connector."
				""
				""
				"&2Step 3:&r If you have Chests that are in a further location, you can use an item &6called Inventory Cable Connector&r against the chest, make sure to use Shift to do so and then you use another item called&6 Inventory Cable&r to make a connection from the &6Cable Connector&r to the I&6nventory Connector&r to read the chests contents even though it’s further away."
